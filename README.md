# MYREADS

# I started to Create my React App localy by useing command `create-react-app`

# then using command `cd to dir of app` ### `npm start`

# I finished the design and used MUI ICONS in some components

# I started to fetching data from API In `BooksApi.js` and handled the data using functions in this page

# I also handled the search page and I used Router to navigate between Home and search components

# OK that is everything ðŸ˜„
